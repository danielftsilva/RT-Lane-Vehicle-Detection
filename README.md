# RT-Lane-Vehicle-Detection
Real-time detection of lanes and vehicles using OpenCV and OpenCL. This project processes video footage from a car's camera, identifies lane lines, and detects vehicles, marking those in the same lane in red and others in green. Utilizes GPU acceleration for enhanced performance.
